👋 Hi, I'm Ritesh Pandey, a 3rd-year Computer Science and Engineering student specialising in Cybersecurity at the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Kottayam. I have a strong interest in problem-solving using Python and C++, and I am increasingly focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, particularly in data-driven and security-related applications.

💡 I enjoy building practical, user-oriented solutions, exploring new technologies, and applying analytical thinking to real-world problems. Recently, I have been developing projects in Natural Language Processing and machine learning, strengthening my foundation in data analysis and model-driven problem solving.

🚀 I aim to advance my career in AI and Machine Learning, working on intelligent systems and data-centric solutions that create meaningful real-world impact.
